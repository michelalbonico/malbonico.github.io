      I am an Adjunct Associate Professor at the Technological Federal University of Paraná (UTFPR), Brazil, where 
      I teach software engineering and distributed programming courses. 
      I also lead the research group (IntelAgir), as well as technological and research projects.
      I hold my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering from IMT Atlantique, Nantes, France. 
      Since my doctorate, I have been seeking international experiences, and besides the period in France,
      I have also spent some time in Amsterdam (with S2 Group@VU Amsterdam), the Netherlands, and Stuttgart (with ICM@University of Stuttgart), Germany.

      Recently, I have also adventured as a hobbyist full-stack software developer.

          Thesis: ***Controlling Cloud-based Systems for Elasticity Testing***
            - The main goal of testing elastic CBS is to verify how the system works in the presence of elasticity. 
            More specifically, testers may need to test CBS throughout a preset elastic behavior.
            For instance, one could need to test a CBS by interleaving resource scale out and in, which should reproduce most of CBS adaptations. 
            Since elasticity controllers react to variations in the workload, to drive the CBS, tests must lead workload variations that result in the preset elastic behavior. 
            However, this faces a challenge in estimating the workload variations. 
            Indeed, the effect of a workload depends on the CBS and the resource that hosts it. 
            Therefore, the CBS driving depends on profiling the effects of the workload on the CBS, and then, calculating and generating the workload variations.
